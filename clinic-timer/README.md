# Clinic Timer

This app is intended to help clinicians keep track of time spent on outpatient office visits. Visit complexity can be coded based on total time spent on the office visit and the documentation.  Create a separate timer for each appointment slot on your schedule.  Tap the timer to start and again to pause.  To the right of the elapsed time, you will see what level of visit, 1 - 5, your encounter is.  For very prolonged office visits, it will prompt to add a 99417 code for every 15 minutes beyond the maximum for a level 5 visit. 

## How to run

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
